## Web Development Hackaton

The first step for the hackathon is to understand the difference between two layout systems: Flexbox (one dimension) and Grid (two dimensions).

### Flexbox
CSS Flexbox offers a one-dimensional layout. It is useful for allocating and aligning the space between items in a container (made of grids). Works with all types of display devices and screen sizes.

### Grid
CSS Grid Layout, is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system with rows and columns, making it easy to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning. Like tables, the grid layout allows us to align elements in columns and rows.

## Overview
In this Hackathon you will be presented with the requirements to create a static website for DF Cinemas.

DF Cinemas has approached us to create a modern looking website promoting their cinemas. In the first iteration, they would like to be able to provide their customers with general information about their cinemas, schedule and opening hours and allow them to subscribe to receive some promotional materials.

The business representatives have worked with our UI/UX team and they have created the following low fidelity mock-ups. They understand that their customers view their pages on different devices and want us to accommodate to this. The site will be split into three pages:

- home page with information about the Cinemas;
- a 'schedule' page displaying opening hours and movies showing this week;
- a 'signup' page to gather some information about the user.

The navigation between the pages should be easy and straightforward, with a navigation bar on top of each page.

## User Stories
The User Stories have been prioritised and ordered from 1 (most important) to 5 (least important):

1. As a User, I want to be presented with a home page, so that I can see some general information and pictures showing DF Cinemas.
2. As a User, I want to be able to see the opening hours of the cinema, so that I know when the cinema is open.
3. As a User, I want to be able to see the movie schedule for this week, so that I know what is on and at what time.
4. As a User, I want to be able to subscribe to the website using a form, so that I can receive the latest promotions and information.
5. As a User, I want to be able to access the website on any device, so that I can access the information I need on the device of my choice.
